Once again, write a script that takes in arguments and displays all
values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the
argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
-Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password,
database name and state name searched (safe from MySQL injection)
-You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
-Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
-Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
-Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
-Your code should not be executed when imported
